# **Customer Churn Prediction Project**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning models and techniques. By identifying customers who are likely to discontinue services, appropriate retention strategies can be developed to enhance customer loyalty and satisfaction.

## **Dataset**

The dataset includes customer details such as CreditScore, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, and EstimatedSalary.

## **Models**

Models used in this project include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, with a focus on hyperparameter tuning, threshold adjustments, and feature engineering such as polynomial features to enhance predictive performance.

## **Evaluation**

Evaluation metrics used include the F1 score, precision, and recall, aiming for a balance that ensures model reliability and robustness in predicting customer churn.

## **Visualizations**

Various visualizations have been employed for an insightful understanding of the data and model performance, such as feature importance plots and F1 score vs. threshold plots.

## **Conclusion**

The project concludes with a robust model capable of predicting customer churn, aiding in the development of effective customer retention strategies.
